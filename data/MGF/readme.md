# a test set of MGF files for ChemDistiller
Files with extension name  '.mgf' can be converted to chemdistiller input files like txt files under folder 
<chemdistiller folder>/data/MassBankTestSpectra/ .

Open the terminal and type in the following command:
`python MGF2ChemDistiller.py <input_folder_fullname or input_file_fullname> (<output_folder_fullname>)`

MGF2ChemDistiller.py module will create a single file for each spectra.

The default output folder is a created dirctory named 'default' under the same directory as the input folder or file, and 
new created files have the same name as its parent mgf files.

Professor Fiehnâ€™s laboratory owns datasets under this directory.
