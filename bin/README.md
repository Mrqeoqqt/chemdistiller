# Various scripts used at some point to generate databases, test datasets etc. Currently unsorted. In the future versions
will be replaced with the pipeline scripts to generate HDF5 compound databases and update them as necessary.
For now if you need to generate your custom DBs - please contact the authors and we will guide you through the
existing scripts or do it for you (given the DB is of reasonable size) as writing comprehensive
description and documentation for each script is not feasible at the moment as they soon will be replaced.
